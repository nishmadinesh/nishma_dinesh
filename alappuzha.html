                The Alleppey backwaters  was earlier used as a mode of transportation, fishing and agriculture and have evolved over time as a tourism hotspot. The main attraction of the Alleppey backwaters is the overnight journey in the famous Kerala houseboats. These houseboats are as comfortable as any hotel room - sometimes even more luxurious, and as a bonus, you get the open deck.

              Sunset viewing, bird watching, village visits, stargazing, witnessing the everyday life of the farmers and fishermen along with visiting the various regions that specialise in the manufacture of certain products like toddy, coir, handicrafts - Alleppey is a handful of an experience to have.
